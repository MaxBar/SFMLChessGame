# SFMLChessGame

TO GET THE PROJECT TO PLAY THE LIB FOLDER HAS TO BE ADDED AS DEPENDENCY SO THAT THE PROGRAM KNOWS WHERE THE JSFML LIBRARY IS AT.

It is sadly not in a finished state and the check mate is not working as it should and thus the game can break. To go forward just press space and it will iterate through the moves for each space that is pressed.
